## Upgrade Instructions

Once the upgrade height has been reached, your validator will throw a consensus error showing that a new binary is needed to perform the upgrade. It is recommended that you build this from source using the following instructions:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noble-assets/noble
# Navigate to the repository
cd noble
# Checkout the release tag
git checkout v5.0.0
# Build from source
make install
```

Verifying the checksum of your built binary is crucial to ensure you're running the correct version.
